Y as is DRY and CRY?
-- avoiding CRY at level 2 but DRY is OK?

LEVEL 4

ING? As in "FINGER" (no ng-coalescence?) rather than SING

Otherwise---
"Kid Mum": spring, sing (sang, song, long, strong)
"Bad": (long)
"Dog Man": bring (long)
"Gad Men": thing (strong, bang)

- ULL (not the same U as UP or FUN)
- OLL (not the same O as ON or TOP)


LEVEL 7
- add S sounding like Z like in ROSE, RISE, RAISE?
