Kat
sat
with
a
hand
on
the
bump
She
felt
the
bub
kick
and
twist
at
the
press
This
bub
that
is
Kat's
kid
Kat's
bub
her
kid
her
little
man
OMG
Thick
sad
drops
went
drip
drip
drip
in
to
Kat
dry
hands
Last
spring
Kat
was
just
a
kid
in
class
She
got
A+
in
maths
A
maths
quiz
in
class
is
a
long
jump
from
this
This
is
just
mad
