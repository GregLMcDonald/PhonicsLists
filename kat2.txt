Kat had met Sam’s dad, Mick, at a gig in the spring. He was from a rap band and he sang well. Mick sang the songs and his four pals did the rap bits. The band- Hot Jinx- was the best band at the gig. The band was the next big thing. It was a hit.
Kat went to the gig with Sid and Jan. Sid, Jan and Kat had met in class last spring. Sid was a whizz in Lit class and Jan was a ‘get fit’ class fan but Kat was best at Maths. The 3 of them got on so well. Class was fun.
 The 3 pals sang well too. Kat sang with a soft lilt but Sid was best at the sad songs. Jan sang a bit but was best at the jazz steps she did as Kat and Sid sang. It was fun to think that the 3 of them had a bit of a band.
As best pals that sang in a band, Kat, Jan and Sid went to lots of gigs. The 3 of them went and had fun. It was a blast in spring when a run of 8 gigs was held. It was held on the grass at the end of the track that led to the shops. The 3 kids got a cut-cost pass from Jan’s dad. (Jan’s dad had pals in the club that set up and ran the gigs.)
